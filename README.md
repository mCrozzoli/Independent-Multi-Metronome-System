# Independent-Multi-Metronome-System
work in progress for an interactive and independent multi metronome system.

A description is coming soon... 
but if you would like to give it a try, with this script I am using a MIDI controller called nanokontrol2 from KORG.
The python script is only the controller and ui for the conductor of the ensemble. Coming soon a serial port and wifi communication implementation for esp32 to send the click information to the musicians. :)
